# CFC Rules Model
Countries are rewarded for not having CFC rules, but then, if they do have the rules, they are still rewarded for only taxing passive income or providing a list of exempted countries.

Good CFC regimes only tax passive income and provide exemptions. Zero is the best score

## Exists: determines if the country has CFC rules or not.

    Equal to 1 if CFC rules exist and 0 if CFC rules do not exist.

## Active: determines if the country's CFC regime taxes active income

    Equal to 1 if CFC rules apply to active income and equal to 0 if they apply only to passive income or the country does not have a CFC regime

## Exemption: determines if the country has exemptions to its CFC regime

    Equal to 1 if CFC rules do not have exemptions; equal to zero if there are no CFC rules or if there are exemptions.
